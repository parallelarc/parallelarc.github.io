Hi, I am Jianwei Ren, a graduate student from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn). My research interests are **3D Vision, Autonomous Driving and Unsupervised Representation Learning**. 

I was an intern at Xiaomi EV, working with Dr. Guang Li and [Dr. Kuiyuan Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g2gAY_0AAAAJ), and during which I secured 2nd place in the Mapless Driving track of the CVPR2024 [Autonomous Grand Challenge](https://opendrivelab.com/challenge2024/#mapless_driving). I earned my BEng (2021) with a UK First Class Honours Degree from the joint program between BUPT and [Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/). I am fortunate to have received recommendation letters from Dr. Kuiyuan Yang and [President Kun XU](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/info/1274/84949.htm) of BUPT.

:fire: **I'm actively on the hunt for a PhD opportunity. Should you come across any promising leads, I'd be delighted to hear from you. My [CV](/files/CV_JianweiREN.pdf) and [research proposal](/files/Research Proposal_SMTP.pdf) are available.**

    </h2>
    <p>Guang Li*, <b>Jianwei Ren*</b>, Quanyun Zhou, Anbin Xiong, Kuiyuan Yang <br>
      <b>CVPR Workshop, 2024</b><br>
      This work is a technical report for Mapless Driving, achieving 2nd place on the OpenLane-V2 leaderboard. A "lane-crosswalk-boundary" joint training framework is adopted to detect vectorized traffic elements, demonstrating that employing appropriate representations for traffic elements and incorporating SD map into BEV generation significantly enhance performance. Additionally, a YOLOv8-based multi-scale framework is employed for detecting traffic signs. We also introduce geometric priors to refine topological modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results.

    <p><b>Jianwei Ren</b><br>
      <b>ArXiv, 2024</b><br>
      This work is the first to introduce adaptive discrete strategy into the self-supervised monocular depth estimation community. Through global perception of distinct scenes, a learnable module is designed to dynamically allocate pixels into bins with adaptive depth values.
